# 📝 Blog App — My First Angular Project 🚀

This is my first Angular project!  
I'm learning Angular on the go by building a simple blog page.

## 📚 Topics Covered (or will be covered)

- Angular File Structure
- Component Lifecycle (first 4 hooks)
- Signals (Readable & Writable)
- Reactive Forms
- Data Sharing Between Components
- @Input & @Output
- Observables (API Calling)
- Angular Router
- Auth Guard

I'll keep updating this project and README as I continue learning. 💡

## ⚙️ Angular CLI Generated Info

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.2.

---

## 🚀 Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:4200/
```

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## 🛠️ Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

---

## 🏗️ Building the Project

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.  
By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

---

## ✅ Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

---

## 🔎 Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests

For end-to-end testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

> ⚠️ Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default.  
> You can choose and configure one that suits your project’s needs (like Cypress or Protractor).
